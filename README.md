# NEGF Method Simulations

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks implementing the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism for analyzing quantum transport in low-dimensional systems. The simulations cover electron transmission, quantum point contacts, and the impact of scattering centers using a tight-binding framework.
